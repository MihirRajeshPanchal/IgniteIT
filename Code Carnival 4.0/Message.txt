You are cordially invited to participate in Codeathlon, an exciting coding competition that consists of three rounds: Elementary, Intermediate, and Expert.

In the Elementary round, you will be challenged with a menti quiz. The teams that perform the best will be awarded points based on their ranking. 75% of the teams will be selected 

In the intermediate round of Codeathlon, known as Coder relay, teams will have to work together to complete a coding task. One player will work on the task for 20 minutes, and then they will switch out with another team member, who will continue the code from where the previous player left off. This round will test the teams' ability to work together and communicate effectively, as well as their coding skills. Points will be allotted in the same way as the elementary round, with the top-performing teams receiving the most points.

In the Expert round of Codeathlon, an algorithm will be given to each team, and the entire team will have to code a solution for the given algorithm. This round will test the teams' logic building as well as their ability to work together as a team to come up with a solution. The top 3 teams will be awarded at the end of this round. This round is considered as the final round of the competition and the scores of this round will be considered as the final scores of the competition.
